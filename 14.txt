Assignment 14 
Create an elastic IP for an instance. 
✅ Objective 
Learn how to create and assign an Elastic IP to an EC2 instance so that its public IP remains static, 
even if the instance is stopped and started again. 
�
� Why Elastic IP? 
When you stop and restart an EC2 instance, the public IPv4 address changes. This is a problem if: 
 You're hosting a website or application. 
 You're using a custom domain that points to that IP. 
To prevent this, Elastic IP acts as a static IP that you can attach to any EC2 instance, ensuring 
consistent access.

 ️ Steps to Perform the Lab 
A. Create an EC2 Instance 
1. Login to AWS Console → Go to EC2 Dashboard. 
2. Click “Instances (Running)” > Click “Launch Instance”. 
3. Name your instance 
Under Name and tags, enter: 
➤ Snehaec2WebServer (or any preferred name) 
4. Choose OS Image (AMI) 
➤ Under Application and OS Images, select: 
o Quick Start 
o Ubuntu (Free Tier Eligible) 
5. Create or Select a Key Pair 
o Choose an existing key pair or click Create new key pair 
o Give a name like snehaa1234 
o Select:  
 Key pair type: RSA 
 File format: .pem 
o Click Create key pair and download the .pem file 
6. Choose Instance Type 
➤ Keep default: t2.micro (Free Tier Eligible) 
7. Configure Security Group (Firewall Rules) 
Select Create security group and check all three options: 
o ✅ Allow SSH (for connecting to instance) 
o ✅ Allow HTTPS (secure web access) 
o ✅ Allow HTTP (web access) 
8. Launch Instance

o Review summary 
o Click Launch Instance 
o On confirmation page, click “View all instances” 
B. Observe Public IP Change on Restart 
1. Copy current Public IPv4 address of your instance 
➤ Found in instance details pane 
2. Stop the instance 
➤ Actions > Instance state > Stop instance 
3. Start the instance again 
➤ Actions > Instance state > Start instance 
4. Check the Public IPv4 address again 
➤ You'll notice it has changed 
✅ Confirms why Elastic IP is needed. 
C. Allocate an Elastic IP 
1. On left menu, go to: 
➤ Network & Security > Elastic IPs 
2. Click Allocate Elastic IP address 
3. Keep default settings and click Allocate 
D. Associate Elastic IP with Instance 
1. Select the newly allocated IP 
➤ Click “Associate Elastic IP address” 
2. In the form that opens: 
o Resource Type: Select Instance 
o Instance: Select your current running EC2 instance 
o Private IP: Keep default 
o ✅ Check “Allow this Elastic IP address to be reassociated” 
3. Click Associate 
E. Verify Elastic IP Behavior 
1. Copy current Public IPv4 address (this is now your Elastic IP) 
2. Stop and start the instance again as before 
Assignment 14 
3. Check the Public IPv4 address again 
➤ You'll see it hasn’t changed this time ✅ 
�
� Success! Your instance now has a static IP. 
F. Clean Up (Optional) 
If you want to remove the Elastic IP: 
1. Disassociate Elastic IP 
➤ Go to Elastic IPs > Select IP > Actions > Disassociate Elastic IP 
2. Release Elastic IP 
➤ After disassociation, select again > Actions > Release Elastic IP 
�
� Summary 
Without Elastic IP 
With Elastic IP 
Public IP changes after restart Static IP remains the same 
Manual DNS update needed No DNS changes required 
Less reliable for hosted apps Ideal for hosting apps/websites
