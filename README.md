Task 1- House Price Prediction using Linear Regression Model.

• Data Preparation: 
Handled data ingestion from CSV format, ensuring seamless integration for analysis and modeling. 

• Data Visualization: 
-> Visualised  Data in various plots using matplotlib Library and Seaborn Library. 
-> Checked for missing values and duplicate rows. 
-> Checked correlation coefficient of features to the target variable using seaborn. 

• Model Development: 
Constructed a Linear Regression model,  utilizing the scikit-Learn library to train and test the predictive algorithm. 

• Model Training: 
-> Split data into training and test sets using scikit-learn. 
-> Create linear regression model from the data. 

• Performance evaluation:
Evaluated the model's efficacy on visualizing the Predicted price.
