Part 1: Create a Public Bucket 
1. Sign in to AWS: 
o Log in to the AWS Management Console. 
o Navigate to the Amazon S3 Console. 
2. Navigate to Buckets: 
o From the left-hand menu, select Buckets. 
3. Create a Bucket: 
o Click Create bucket. 
o On the Create bucket page:  
 Bucket Name: Enter a unique name for your bucket (e.g., 
snehapublicbucket). 
 Region: Select your preferred AWS Region. 
4. Set Object Ownership: 
o Under Object Ownership, enable ACLs to control ownership of uploaded 
objects. 
o Choose Bucket owner enforced – ACLs enabled. 
5. Adjust Public Access Settings: 
o Uncheck the Block Public Access settings for this bucket checkbox. 
o Tick the acknowledgment box confirming your choice. 
6. Create the Bucket: 
o Click Create Bucket to finalize the process. 
Part 2: Upload Files and Grant Public Access 
1. Open the Bucket: 
o After creation, locate your bucket in the list and click its name. 
2. Upload Files: 
o Within the bucket, click Upload. 
o On the upload page, click Add files and select the file(s) to upload. 
o Click Upload to complete the process. 
3. Set Permissions for Uploaded Files: 
o Select the uploaded file and navigate to the Permissions tab. 
o Under Access Control List (ACL), click Edit. 
4. Grant Public Access: 
o Check the Read permission boxes for Object and Object's ACL under 
Everyone (public access). 
o Tick the acknowledgment box confirming you understand the changes. 
o Click Save changes. 
5. Verify Public Access: 
o Go to the Properties tab of the uploaded file. 
o Copy the Object URL. 
o Paste the URL into a web browser. 
If permissions are correctly set, the file should be accessible publicly. 
Important Notes: 
 Failing to edit the permissions under the ACL will result in access denial, even if the 
bucket is marked as public. 
 Ensure the bucket name is unique across AWS. 
 Publicly accessible files may expose sensitive data if permissions are not carefully 
managed.
