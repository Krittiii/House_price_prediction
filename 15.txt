Assignment 15 
Create Serverless Computing Service using AWS Lambda 
�
� Objective 
To create and deploy a simple AWS Lambda function that prints a custom welcome message — 
demonstrating serverless computing on AWS. 
�
� Part 1: Creating the Lambda Function 
✅ Step 1: Open Lambda Service 
1. Log in to your AWS Console: https://aws.amazon.com/console/ 
2. In the Search bar, type Lambda and click on it. 
Explanation: 
AWS Lambda lets you run code without managing servers. You only focus on writing the function 
logic. 
✅ Step 2: Create the Function 
1. Click on the “Create function” button. 
2. Select “Author from scratch.” 
✅ Step 3: Set Function Details 
 Function name: e.g., func_x1 
 Runtime: Choose Python 3.9 or any preferred runtime (Node.js, etc.) 
Tip: The runtime determines what programming language your Lambda function will use. 
3. Scroll down and leave all other settings as default. 
4. Click Create function. 
✅ Step 4: Modify the Code 
1. Wait for the function page to load. You’ll be taken to the function dashboard. 
2. Under the Code tab, locate and open the index.mjs or main file (for Python, it might be 
lambda_function.py).

3. Replace any occurrence of the word “lambda” with “sneha” in the sample code. 
✍
 ️ Example (Node.js): 
export const handler = async (event) => { 
const response = { 
statusCode: 200, 
body: JSON.stringify('Welcome from Sneha!'), 
}; 
return response; 
}; 
4. Click File > Save to save the code. 
�
� Part 2: Test the Lambda Function 
✅ Step 5: Create and Run a Test Event 
1. Click on the Test button (top-right). 
2. Select “Create new test event.” 
3. Give it an Event name, e.g., eve1. 
4. Leave the default JSON data as is (you don’t need to change anything). 
5. Click Save. 
6. Now click Test to execute the Lambda function. 
�
� Note: If you don’t see your message change (e.g., “sneha”), it means you haven’t deployed the latest 
code yet. 
✅ Step 6: Deploy and Re-Test 
1. Click the Deploy button to apply your code changes. 
2. Click Test again to see the updated result. 
�
� Part 3: Expose Your Lambda Function via URL 
✅ Step 7: Create Function URL 
1. Go to the Configuration tab. 
2. Under the left-side menu, click Function URL. 
3. Click Create function URL. 
4. For Auth type, choose None. 
5. Click Save.

✅ Step 8: Test the URL 
1. Once the Function URL is created, click on it. 
2. A new browser tab opens, showing your Lambda function output (e.g., "Welcome from 
Sneha!"). 
⚠
 ️ If you see an error, ensure your function code returns a valid HTTP response. 
�
� Part 4: Clean Up Resources 
To avoid unnecessary AWS charges: 
✅ Step 9: Delete Resources 
1. Go back to Configuration > Function URL and delete the URL. 
2. Then return to the Lambda dashboard, select your function, and click Delete. 
�
� Expected Output 
 After deployment and testing, your function should return: 
"Welcome from Sneha!" 
 You should be able to view this output via the Test button and directly from the Function URL.
