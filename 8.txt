Assignment-8 
Deploying a Project from Local Machine to GitHub and 
Vice Versa 
Overview 
This guide explains: 
1. Creating a GitHub repository 
2. Generating a GitHub authentication token 
3. Uploading files to GitHub using Git Bash 
4. Cloning a repository to a local machine 
Remark: Git is an open-source version control system that tracks changes in source code. 
This process allows developers to manage and share their projects effectively. 
Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository 
1. Go to GitHub and sign in or create an account. 
2. Click on the GitHub logo (top left). 
3. Under Top Repositories, click New. 
4. Enter a Repository Name (e.g., MYNEWREPO). 
5. Choose Public or Private (Here, we select Private). 
6. Click Create Repository. 
Remark: A repository is a storage location for project files and their revision history. 
Step 2: Generate a GitHub Authentication Token 
GitHub authentication tokens are required for secure access without passwords. 
1. Click on your Profile Name → Settings. 
2. Go to Developer Settings (left sidebar). 
3. Click Tokens (Classic) → Generate New Token (Classic). 
4. Enter a Token Name (e.g., tok2). 
5. Set an Expiration Period (e.g., 90 days). 
6. Check all required permissions. 
7. Click Generate Token and Copy the Token for later use. 
Remark: The token replaces your GitHub password for authentication when using Git. 
Step 3: Upload Files to GitHub Using Git Bash 
Prerequisites: 
 Install Git for Windows if not already installed. 
Process: 
1. Navigate to Your Project Folder: 
o On your desktop, locate the folder containing project files. 
o Right-click inside the folder and select Git Bash Here. 
2. Initialize Git in the Folder: 
git init 
o This creates a new Git repository in the folder. 
3. Configure Git User Details: 
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com" 
o This links your local Git to your GitHub account. 
4. Stage Files for Commit: 
git add . 
o This adds all files in the folder to Git’s tracking system. 
5. Commit the Files with a Message: 
git commit -m "Initial commit" 
o This saves the changes locally with a message. 
6. Connect to the Remote Repository: 
git remote add origin "https://github.com/yourusername/MYNEWREPO.git" 
o This links your local repository to the GitHub repository. 
7. Push the Files to GitHub: 
git push -f origin master 
o A popup window appears asking for credentials. 
o Enter the authentication token instead of the password. 
Remark: If successful, all files will be visible in the GitHub repository. 
Step 4: Clone a GitHub Repository to a Local Machine 
Scenario: 
We want to download an existing repository (https://github.com/sudip7407/New
Repo1.git) to our local machine. 
Process: 
1. Create a New Folder on your desktop (e.g., folder2). 
2. Right-click the folder → Git Bash Here. 
3. Clone the GitHub Repository: 
git clone "https://github.com/sudip7407/New-Repo1.git" 
o This downloads the repository to the local machine. 
4. Verify Files Are Downloaded: 
ls 
o This lists all files in the cloned repository. 
5. Navigate Inside the Cloned Repository: 
cd New-Repo1 
6. Check Repository Files: 
ls 
o This displays the files copied from GitHub. 
Remark: You can now modify files and push updates back to GitHub using the steps from 
Step 3 (excluding token creation). 
Final Notes 
 Authentication tokens expire after a set period; regenerate if needed. 
 Using git push -f overwrites changes in the remote repository. Be cautious. 
 Ensure Git is installed before attempting commands. 
 Use SSH authentication instead of tokens for enhanced security.
